<p> Keep scrolling, but something feels... off. Can you figure it out?</p>

<hr>
<p>When we access the challenge link, we are directed to a website that looks like a newspaper page.</p>
<img src="./imgs/newsleaks2-1.png">
<p>Let's examine the source code of this website.</p>
<img src="./imgs/newsleaks0.png">
<p>The website runs a script, but it doesn't seem to be what we are looking to exploit. (This script simply changes the articles when we click 'Next' or 'Previous.').</p>
<p>I will use Burp Suite to capture the packets and see what we find.</p>
<img src="./imgs/newsleaks1.png">
<p>Oh! Two packets are sent, and the suspicious one is <code>/view.php?file=newspaper1.html</code>. </p>
<img src="./imgs/newsleaks2.png">
<p>What happens if we pass a different path after <code>?file=</code>? This looks like it could be a <b>Path Traversal</b> vulnerability.</p>
<img src="./imgs/newsleaks3.png">
<img src="./imgs/newsleaks4.png">
<p>It appears that the filter blocks <code>./</code> when the dots are adjacent, so I will try using <code>...//</code>.</p>
<img src="./imgs/newsleaks5.png">
<p>It seems that the flag isn't in the <code>flag.txt</code> file, so let's search for it in <code>/etc/passwd.</code></p>
<img src="./imgs/newsleaks6.png">
<p>Boom! The flag is here.</p>

Flag: <code>H7CTF{54n1t1z3_L0c4l_F1l3_1nclusi0n}</code>
