# 🏆 CTF Write-ups Repository 🧩

## 👋 About Me
Hey there! I'm an enthusiastic **CTF player** with a passion for **web exploitation**. Uncovering hidden vulnerabilities in web applications and pushing them to their limits is my idea of fun! The art of bypassing security and exploring the unknown is what drives me in every challenge.

I also dabble in **OSINT**, where I get to play the role of a digital detective. It's always a fascinating journey to recover traces and piece together puzzles from the digital evidence left behind.

This repo is where I keep detailed write-ups of the challenges I've solved — a little treasure chest of knowledge and experience gained from my CTF journey. Whether you're learning or just curious, dive in and explore!

## 📝 CTF Write-ups
Here’s a list of the CTF competitions I’ve participated in. Each link will take you to a folder containing my write-ups for that specific competition:

- 🏅 [PatriotCTF 2024](./PatriotCTF_2024) – 700 points

Stay tuned for more write-ups as I continue to tackle new CTFs!

Happy hacking! 🎯
