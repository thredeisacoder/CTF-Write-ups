<hr>
<p>This challenge is a variation of the 'Newsleaks' challenge, and once again, we will be exploiting Path Traversal. <br>I attempted the same method as in the previous challenge, but this time, the <code>./</code> characters placed together are filtered and replaced with the <code>#</code> character.</p>

<p>Therefore, we will exploit it differently by using the <code>file://{path}</code> format.</p>

<p>As expected, we succeeded with <code>file:///etc/passwd.</code></p>
