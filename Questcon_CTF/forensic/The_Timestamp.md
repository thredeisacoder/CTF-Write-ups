<h1>The Timestamp (100 points)</h1>
<p>Scenario:<br>The Professor and his crew have pulled off their biggest heist yet, but the police are hot on their trail. During their digital forensics investigation, the authorities have stumbled upon a critical file, malware.exe, on a suspect's computer. The timestamps on the file could reveal key details about the heist timeline, but it seems that the crew has altered them to cover their tracks!<br>The investigators suspect that Berlin, the mastermind behind the digital side of the operation, used a tool called Timestomp to manipulate the timestamps and throw the authorities off their trail. But with the right tools, you, as a digital forensics expert, can uncover the truth.<br>The $MFT (Master File Table) has been exported from the system, and the police have analyzed it using the AnalyzeMFT tool. Now itâ€™s up to you to figure out whether Berlin tampered with the file's timestamps and uncover the real modification time of the file.</p>
