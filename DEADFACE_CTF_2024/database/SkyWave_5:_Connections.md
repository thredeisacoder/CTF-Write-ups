<h1> SkyWave 5: Connections (200 points)</h1>
<p>Weâ€™re running with an assumption that <code>d34th</code> drove around and connected to various cell towers the day leading up to the attack.</p>
<p> We need you to determine which device IMEI connected to the most unique towers on <b>September 7 from 16:10 to 18:54</b>.<br>Submit the flag as <code>flag{device_imei}</code>. Example: <code>flag{123456789012345}</code>.</p>
