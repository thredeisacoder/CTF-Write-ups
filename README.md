## 👋 About Me
Hey there! I'm an enthusiastic **CTF player** with a passion for **Web Exploitation**. Uncovering hidden vulnerabilities in web applications and pushing them to their limits is my idea of fun! The art of bypassing security and exploring the unknown is what drives me in every challenge.

I also enjoy delving into the world of **OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)**. Whether it's uncovering hidden information or piecing together public data to solve mysteries, I find OSINT challenges fascinating. It's like a digital treasure hunt where every clue brings you closer to the truth!

This repo is where I keep detailed write-ups of the challenges I've solved — a little treasure chest of knowledge and experience gained from my CTF journey. Whether you're learning or just curious, dive in and explore!
