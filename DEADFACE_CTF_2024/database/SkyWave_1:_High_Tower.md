<h1> SkyWave 1: High Tower (5 points)</h1>
<p> We need your help tracking down <code>d34th</code>, the leader of DEADFACE. He recently conducted an attack against SkyWave Telecommunications. We’ve received cell tower data that might help us pinpoint <code>d34th</code>’s device and potentially lead us to his identity.
<br>But first, we need to assess your familiarity with SQL and the data you’re being provided.
<br>What is the <code>tower_id</code> of the cell tower that sits at an approximate elevation of 220 ft?
<br>Submit the flag as <code>flag{tower_id}</code>. Example: <code>flag{10}</code>.</p>
<p>Access the database via SSH at <code>skywave.deadface.io</code>.
