<h1> Cup of Compromised Joe (20 points)</h1>
<p> After cyber stalking mirvealâ€™s online activity for several weeks, we have finally found a post on <a href="https://ghosttown.deadface.io/t/cup-of-compromised-joe">GhostTown</a> that should allow us to zero in on his location. By examining the photo in this post, can you determine the city and zip code of where he enjoys getting his coffee?</p>
<p>Submit the flag as <code>flag{City-zip}</code>.</p>
